    I'm a second year PhD. student at ENS Lyon. My main area of research is combinatorial scientific computing (CSC). I am interested in problems with combinatorial and HPC aspect arising in (multi)linear algebra, scientific computing, and machine learning.
    I focus on developing fast algorithms, modeling/analyzing their complexity, and providing very efficient (parallel) implementations to run on modern HPC architectures for key computational methods in these areas.
    Specifically, in my thesis I concentrate on high performance parallel tensor computations.
    I consider myself to be a computer scientist as well as a software engineer.

    Before arriving at ENS Lyon, I completed my masters studies on computational science and engineering in Georgia Tech.
    During these years, I had the chance perform two awesome internships as a software engineer in the cuSPARSE team of NVIDIA in Santa Clara, CA, and the Philantropy team of Palantir in Palo Alto, CA.
